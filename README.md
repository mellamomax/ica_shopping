with 'ab95586e-ffd3-4927-bfc7-85d1c5193dbb' being your list_id


## Sync Logic

- ICA â†’ Keep: Items added in ICA appear in Keep
- Keep â†’ ICA: Items added in Keep are synced to ICA
- Items removed in Keep are also removed from ICA
- Recent Keep adds/removes are respected to avoid sync conflicts
- Sensor is updated automatically after every change


## Automation Example - Dont know if theres a polling limit right now. use with causion

Sync ICA â†’ Keep every 5 minutes:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Sync ICA List Every 5 Minutes"
    trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        minutes: "/5"
    action:
      - service: ica_shopping.refresh
```



## Sensor Output

The sensor shows:
- Native value: number of items in the ICA list
- Attributes:
  - `list_name`: name of the list
  - `vara_1`, `vara_2`, ...: each individual item as a separate attribute
